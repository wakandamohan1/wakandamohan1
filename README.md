# 🌟 About Me

Data Enthusiast || Storyteller with Numbers || Passionate about BI & Analytics

I'm a Business Analyst with a strong background in sales, business intelligence, and data visualization.

Born and raised in Botswana, my deep connection to Africa inspired my username wakandamohan1—A tribute to Wakanda from Black Panther, symbolizing innovation and resilience.

Just like Wakanda blends technology and tradition, I use Power BI, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel to turn raw data into insightful visualizations that drive decision-making.
